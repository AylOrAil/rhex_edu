## Introduction
Welcome to the RHex Educational repository! This project provides a comprehensive development environment for the RHex robot, leveraging the power of ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) and Gazebo, a popular robot simulation tool. This repository aims to facilitate the learning and development of robotic applications in an educational setting.


## Key Features
- **ROS2 Integration:** Utilize the advanced capabilities of ROS2 for building robust and scalable robotic applications.
- **Gazebo Simulation:** Develop and test your RHex robot algorithms in a realistic simulation environment before deploying them on physical hardware.
- **Educational Resources:** Access a collection of tutorials, sample codes, and documentation designed to help students and educators get started with RHex, ROS2, and Gazebo.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
- **Install Dependencies:** Follow the installation instructions to set up ROS2 and Gazebo on your system.
- **Run Simulations:** Load the provided simulation worlds and launch your first RHex simulation.
- **Explore and Modify:** Dive into the sample projects, modify them, or create your own to enhance your understanding and skills.

### Installation
Step-by-step instructions for setting up the development environment.


## Usage
